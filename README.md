# Lego-English (积木英语) 🧱

> **"I tried to learn English, but it was too hard. I cannot change my IQ, so I decided to change English."**

## 🚩 我们的使命 (Mission)
We don't "learn" English. We "rebuild" it.  
我们不学英语，我们重构英语。

If a word is too complex, it's a lie. If a sentence has too much grammar, it's a barrier.  
如果一个词太复杂，它就是谎言；如果一个句子语法太多，它就是障碍。

## 🧩 第一个逻辑解构 (Example No.1)
**Philosophy: Descartes (笛卡尔)**

* **Traditional:** "I think, therefore I am." (Too much grammar)
* **Lego-English:** `[I]` + `[Think]` + `[Mean]` + `[I]` + `[Live]` 🧱

**Result:** Logic flows. No dictionary needed.  
**结果：** 逻辑自洽，无需词典。
